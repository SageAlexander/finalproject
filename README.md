QUESTIONS:
Are liberal arts colleges doorways to higher earning potential compared to other school types?


!['screenshot1.JPEG', 'College Type Earning'](/screenshot1.JPEG)


Liberal arts colleges are, on average, more expensive to attend than public universities. The mid-career median salary for Liberal arts and Party type of schools are not significantly different, with Liberal Arts school attendees salaries about 5 thousand dollars more per year. If a student incurs significant debt from the more expensive Liberal Arts colleges, it may not be financially wise to attend one over a state/party school. However, the 90th percentile earners from Liberal Arts colleges do make $191,142.86, compared to $166,947.3 for party schools and $173,333.33 for engineering schools. Mid career, high earners in liberal arts therefore earn slightly more than those from these two types of schools whose average salary is higher than the median salary of private art school graduates.

Are party schools any different from state schools in terms of earning potential?




Party school attendees actually make more every year than those who attend state schools. In average mid career median salary, starting median salary, and mid career 90th percentile earners, party school attendees make slightly more on average. Starting median salaries are not significantly different, but still slightly higher.
