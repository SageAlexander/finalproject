# Final Project
### Data By Sage Alexander <br>

This project was made possible by data from the Wall Street Journal, [Where it Pays to Attend College; Salaries by College and College Degree Program](https://www.kaggle.com/wsj/college-salaries/) and Payscale, Inc. 

My google sheets spreadsheet can be found [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mSPW5yizGISr7Jcihzyeh2KGPuX2E4rtufE7YaNjahE/edit?usp=sharing)


#### QUESTIONS:
*1. Are liberal arts colleges doorways to higher earning potential compared to other school types?*

To answer this question, I made a pivot table on Google Sheets. My 'Row' was Type of college (a value I had to add to my spreadsheet), and my 'Values' were Mid-Career Median Salary,	Starting Median Salary, and Mid-Career 90th Percentile Salary. I chose these three values to show the median salary of a well established professional in the field, a recent college graduate, and the highest earners from the college. The starting salary did not tell me much, other than an increased earning potential for Ivy league graduates. I summarized the data by average and sorted by type.

> Liberal arts colleges are, on average, more expensive to attend than public universities. The mid-career median salary for the Liberal arts and Party type of schools are not significantly different, with Liberal Arts school attendees salaries about 5 thousand dollars more per year. If a student incurs significant debt from the more expensive Liberal Arts colleges, it may not be financially wise to attend one over a state/party school. However, the 90th percentile earners from Liberal Arts colleges do make $191,142.86, compared to $166,947.3 for party schools and $173,333.33 for engineering schools. Mid career, high earners from liberal arts colleges therefore earn slightly more on average than those from the two types of schools.

*2. Are party schools any different from state schools in terms of earning potential?*

To answer this, I used the same pivot table as before, but instead looked at the state and party schools. 


> Party school attendees actually made *more* each year than those who attended state schools. In average mid career median salary, starting median salary, and mid career 90th percentile earners, party school attendees make slightly more on average. Starting median salaries are not significantly different, but are higher by over a thousand dollars. 

*3. Do you make more money if you graduate from certain U.S. regions?*

To answer this question, I made another pivot table. My row was region. My value was mid-career median salary, sorted by average. I chose this value because I believe that it encompasses a data point that covers the most general statement about graduates. 


> Both California and the Northeastern regions make $93,132.14 and $91,352.00, respectively. This, compared to sub-80k salaries in the other regions, shows that people that attend colleges in these two areas gross higher salaries on average.
